#PersistentPlex

This app allows you to run your mac as a media centre using Plex without having to worry about the whole system sleep quitting the app thing.

All you have to do is run this app, it'll pop up as a menu bar app, and then whenever your mac wakes from sleep it will launch Plex.
To be honest there is probably a setting in Plex somewhere to look after this for you but oh well, I fancied making it.

Use this code all you like. Cos' I'm nice.
